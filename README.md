## Overview
- Back To Inheritance -> Used inheritance instead of composition for the first time in a few months for this project, to make sure I still remembered how to do it. I do, though it's still worse than comp. in my opinion.
- Art -> One of my few attempts at making non-pixel art art! It went decently, though there are some uncomfortable resolution things going on with the ship.
    - Art made in Krita
## Credits
- All assets, code etc made by me. No credits this week!

## Devlogs
### Monday -> Setup & The Player
- Made the project, imported wakatime.
- Set up the player; controls like a very floaty vehicle, where you press L/R to turn and F/B to go forwards and brake.
### Tuesday -> Basic Planets, UI
- Made planets that glide towards their home point (setup for a tractor beam)
- Made a menu to see and use your collected planets, where you'll be able to sell them for money or break them down into materials.

### Wednesday -> Shop & Planet Randomizing
- Made the shop actually work, and made the planets randomize on spawn. Didn't do much today.
### Thursday
- Put in an absolute GRIND today to get this done early.
- Got ALL the art in.
- The shop finally has more than one upgrade, and a better upgrade system.
